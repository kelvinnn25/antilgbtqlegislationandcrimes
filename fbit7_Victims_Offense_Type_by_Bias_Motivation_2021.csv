"1 The term victim may refer to an individual, business/financial institution, government entity, religious organization, or society/public as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The figures shown are individual victims only.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 The figures shown include additional offenses collected in the National Incident-Based Reporting System. See the downloadable Methodology file for further explanation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 A multiple-bias incident is an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by two or more biases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note:  The aggregate of adult and juvenile individual victims does not equal the total number of victims because total victims include individuals, businesses/financial institutions, government entities, religious organizations, and society/public as a whole. In addition, the aggregate of adult and juvenile individual victims does not equal the aggregate of victims of crimes against persons because not all law enforcement agencies report the ages of individual victims.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
